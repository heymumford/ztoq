### [TEST-PERF-3] Create Performance Test Suite

**Completed**: 2025-04-21
**Summary**: Implemented a comprehensive performance testing framework with base test infrastructure, database tests, and API client tests, including metrics collection, visualization, and statistical analysis.

**Context**: Performance is critical for large-scale test migration scenarios, requiring systematic measurement, benchmarking, and optimization. Effective performance testing requires a structured approach with reproducible results, metrics collection, and visualization capabilities.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Created a robust performance testing framework with:
   - Base `PerformanceTest` class with configurable measurement decorators
   - Standardized metrics collection (duration, memory usage, CPU utilization)
   - Statistical analysis (min, max, mean, median, percentiles, throughput)

### [PERF-5] Implement Connection Pooling for API Clients

**Completed**: 2025-04-20
**Summary**: Created a robust connection pooling system to optimize HTTP connections for high-volume API interactions with Zephyr and qTest.

**Context**: During large migrations, thousands of API calls are made to both Zephyr (source) and qTest (destination) systems. Without connection pooling, each request creates a new TCP connection with the overhead of DNS resolution, TCP handshakes, and SSL handshakes. This significantly slows down the migration process and increases resource usage. Additionally, TCP slow start means new connections initially have limited throughput. Connection pooling addresses these issues by reusing existing connections.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Created a dedicated `connection_pool.py` module with:
   - Pool management per host to maximize connection reuse
   - Thread-safe implementation for concurrent access
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Connection cleanup to prevent resource leaks
   - Performance metrics tracking for monitoring
   - Support for both synchronous and asynchronous clients

2. Integrated the connection pool with both Zephyr and qTest clients:
   - Updated the `_make_request` method to use pooled connections
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing error handling
   - Ensured proper correlation ID propagation

3. Created comprehensive integration tests to validate:
   - Connection reuse behavior
   - Pool size limits
   - Concurrent request handling
   - Cleanup mechanisms
   - Error handling
   - Performance metrics tracking

**Challenges and Solutions**:
- **Challenge**: Maintaining backward compatibility with existing retry mechanisms and error handling.
  **Solution**: Implemented the pool to work seamlessly with existing decorator patterns for retry and circuit breaker functionality.

- **Challenge**: Ensuring thread safety without creating bottlenecks.
  **Solution**: Used fine-grained locking only for critical sections and separate pools per host to reduce contention.

- **Challenge**: Handling authentication token refresh with pooled connections.
  **Solution**: Maintained the existing token refresh pattern while working within the connection pool framework.

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Connection pooling provides significant benefits for high-volume ETL operations with APIs.
2. The biggest performance gains come from reusing connections to the same host.
3. Proper cleanup is essential to prevent resource leaks in long-running processes.
4. Tracking metrics is valuable for identifying optimization opportunities and potential issues.

**Summary**: Implemented a comprehensive database optimization system with query caching, keyset pagination, batch operations, performance monitoring, and optimized transaction management.

**Context**: As the database grows with migration data, database access patterns become a critical performance factor. Inefficient queries, excessive roundtrips, and unoptimized transaction management can severely impact migration throughput. In the context of migrating between test management systems like Zephyr and qTest, this becomes especially important when handling thousands of test cases, test cycles, and test executions with complex relationships.

**Decision**: Created a modular database optimization system with multiple components:

**Context**: To optimize ETL performance, we needed a more intelligent approach to batching than fixed-size batches. Different entities have varying characteristics, and optimal batch sizes depend on multiple factors including memory constraints, processing time, and entity similarities.

**Decision**: Implemented a comprehensive batching strategy system with multiple approaches:
1. `SizeBatchStrategy`: Creates batches based on memory footprint or entity size constraints
2. `TimeBatchStrategy`: Groups entities based on estimated processing time
