### [PERF-5] Implement Connection Pooling for API Clients

**Completed**: 2025-04-20
**Summary**: Created a robust connection pooling system to optimize HTTP connections for high-volume API interactions with Zephyr and qTest.

**Context**: During large migrations, thousands of API calls are made to both Zephyr (source) and qTest (destination) systems. Without connection pooling, each request creates a new TCP connection with the overhead of DNS resolution, TCP handshakes, and SSL handshakes. This significantly slows down the migration process and increases resource usage. Additionally, TCP slow start means new connections initially have limited throughput. Connection pooling addresses these issues by reusing existing connections.

**Implementation Details**:

  **Solution**: Maintained the existing token refresh pattern while working within the connection pool framework.

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Connection pooling provides significant benefits for high-volume ETL operations with APIs.
2. The biggest performance gains come from reusing connections to the same host.
3. Proper cleanup is essential to prevent resource leaks in long-running processes.

**Summary**: Implemented a comprehensive database optimization system with query caching, keyset pagination, batch operations, performance monitoring, and optimized transaction management.

**Context**: As the database grows with migration data, database access patterns become a critical performance factor. Inefficient queries, excessive roundtrips, and unoptimized transaction management can severely impact migration throughput. In the context of migrating between test management systems like Zephyr and qTest, this becomes especially important when handling thousands of test cases, test cycles, and test executions with complex relationships.

**Decision**: Created a modular database optimization system with multiple components:
1. **Query Caching**: Implemented a time-based query cache with TTL expiration for frequently accessed data like projects and folders

**Summary**: Implemented a modular batching strategy system with various batching approaches to optimize performance for different entity types and processing scenarios.

**Context**: To optimize ETL performance, we needed a more intelligent approach to batching than fixed-size batches. Different entities have varying characteristics, and optimal batch sizes depend on multiple factors including memory constraints, processing time, and entity similarities.

**Decision**: Implemented a comprehensive batching strategy system with multiple approaches:
1. `SizeBatchStrategy`: Creates batches based on memory footprint or entity size constraints
2. `TimeBatchStrategy`: Groups entities based on estimated processing time
3. `AdaptiveBatchStrategy`: Learns optimal batch size during execution based on performance
4. `EntityTypeBatchStrategy`: Groups similar entities together (e.g., by folder, priority)

**Rationale**:
- Different entity types have different processing characteristics (memory footprint, complexity)
- Adaptive strategies can learn the optimal batch size during execution
- Grouping similar entities can improve CPU cache utilization
- A modular design allows selecting the best strategy for each situation

**Lessons**:
- Different entity types benefit from different batching strategies
