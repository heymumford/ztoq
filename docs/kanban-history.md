## Phase 8: Project Structure Refinement

### [STRUCT-1] Folder Organization
**Completed**: 2025-05-16
**Context**: The project had grown to the point where organization needed improvement.
**Decision**: Refactored to a more standard structure with separate config/, docs/, and utils/ directories.
**Rationale**: A cleaner structure would improve maintainability and follow open source conventions.
**Lessons**: The reorganization made the codebase more approachable to new contributors by aligning with familiar patterns.

### [STRUCT-2] Open Source Preparation
**Completed**: 2025-05-18
**Context**: Preparing the project for potential open source release.
**Decision**: Added license headers, contributor guidelines, and a code of conduct.
**Rationale**: Proper open source preparation would set the project up for community success.
