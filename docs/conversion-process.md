# Architecture for Zephyr to qTest Migration Tool (ztoq)

## System Overview

The ztoq CLI tool will extract testing data from Zephyr and import it into qTest through a three-phase ETL process:

1. **Extract**: Pull test entities from Zephyr API
2. **Transform**: Convert Zephyr data model to qTest format
3. **Load**: Push transformed data to qTest API

## Key Components

### 1. CLI Interface
- Command parser with subcommands for extraction, transformation, loading, or full ETL
- Configuration management (API keys, endpoints, rate limits)
- Logging and error handling

### 2. Data Model
- SQLite database for intermediate storage
- Entity models for both systems (test cases, test cycles, test executions, attachments)
- Mapping tables for ID correlation between systems

### 3. Extraction Service
- Parallel API client for Zephyr
- Pagination handler
- Rate limiter
- Entity processors for each Zephyr object type
- Attachment downloader

### 4. Transformation Service
- Field mappers for each entity type
- Custom field transformer
- Relationship resolver
- Validation system

### 5. Loading Service
- Parallel API client for qTest
- Transaction manager (rollback capability)
- Error handler with retry logic
- Progress tracker

## Implementation Approach

### Data Flow
1. Extract all test entities from Zephyr with their relationships
2. Store raw data in SQLite with original structure
3. Transform data into qTest model
4. Create relationships in qTest based on Zephyr connections
5. Upload attachments to qTest entities

### Parallel Processing Strategy
- Use asyncio for concurrent API calls
- Producer-consumer pattern with work queues
- Implement backpressure mechanisms
- Chunk entity operations for optimal throughput

### Error Handling
- Transactional boundaries for recoverable operations
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Detailed logging with error contexts
- Resumable operations from checkpoints

## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema
- Zephyr tables: test_cases, test_cycles, test_plans, test_executions, attachments
- qTest mapping tables with correlation IDs
- Status tracking tables for migration progress

### API Interaction
- JWT token management for Zephyr
- OAuth token handling for qTest
- Connection pooling
- Response caching where appropriate

## CLI Command Structure

```
ztoq [options]
  config          Configure API connections
  extract         Extract data from Zephyr
  transform       Transform extracted data
  load            Load transformed data to qTest
  migrate         Run full ETL pipeline
  validate        Validate migration results
  report          Generate migration report
```

## Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Extract
- Set up CLI framework
- Implement database schema
- Build Zephyr API client
- Extract test cases, cycles, and executions
- Download attachments

### Phase 2: Transform
- Define mapping rules
- Implement entity transformers
- Handle custom fields
- Resolve entity relationships

### Phase 3: Load
- Implement qTest API client
- Create entity importers
- Handle attachment uploads
- Implement status tracking

### Phase 4: Validation & Reporting
- Implement validation checks
- Create migration reports
- Add resume capability
- Optimize performance

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for transformers and validators
- Integration tests with mock API responses
- End-to-end tests on sample data
- Performance tests for parallelization

## Challenges & Mitigations

1. **Scale**: Handle large volume of test assets
   - Implement pagination and batching
   - Use incremental migration approach

2. **Attachments**: Transfer binary files efficiently
   - Stream attachments directly between systems when possible
   - Implement checksums for verification

3. **Custom Fields**: Map between different systems
   - Create configurable mapping definitions
   - Implement transformation rules

4. **API Limits**: Manage rate limiting
   - Implement adaptive rate limiting
   - Add backoff strategies

5. **Consistency**: Ensure data integrity
   - Use transactions where possible
   - Implement validation checks
   - Add rollback capability

This architecture provides a robust, efficient framework for migrating test assets from Zephyr to qTest while maintaining data integrity and optimizing for performance through parallel processing.
