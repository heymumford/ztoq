# Open Source Decision Guidance

This document provides practical guidance for engineering teams on when and how to propose open sourcing components of enterprise projects. It builds on the framework established in [ADR-019: Open Source Decision Framework](adr/019-open-source-decision-framework.md) and Eric Mumford's analysis "Open Source vs. Proprietary Software: Navigating the Modern Decision Landscape."

## When to Consider Open Sourcing

Engineering teams should consider proposing open source for components that:

1. **Solve General Problems**: Address challenges common across the industry rather than organization-specific problems
2. **Have Clear Boundaries**: Can be isolated with well-defined interfaces and dependencies
3. **Lack Core IP**: Don't contain critical intellectual property or competitive advantages
4. **Have Community Potential**: Could realistically attract external contributors or users
5. **Would Benefit from Exposure**: Could improve through additional scrutiny and feedback
6. **Enable Interoperability**: Would benefit the ecosystem by standardizing interfaces or protocols
7. **Are Sufficiently Mature**: Have reached a level of quality and stability suitable for public release

## How to Propose Open Sourcing

When preparing a proposal to open source a component, address these key elements:

### 1. Strategic Rationale

Clearly articulate the business value, not just the technical benefits. Executives need to understand how open sourcing aligns with organizational objectives rather than just engineering preferences.

**Do**:
- Connect to specific business outcomes (e.g., "This will accelerate adoption of our API platform")
- Explain how it supports the company's broader technology strategy
- Identify tangible benefits beyond abstract ideals

**Don't**:
- Focus solely on engineering culture benefits
- Assume universal open source benefits will automatically apply
- Rely on ideological arguments without business context

### 2. Resource Commitment

Detail the resources required for a successful open source project, acknowledging that open sourcing increases rather than decreases certain types of work.

**Include**:
- Estimated engineering time for community management
- Documentation requirements
- Infrastructure needs
- Governance approach
- Security review processes

### 3. Risk Assessment

Proactively address potential concerns with a balanced risk assessment.

**Cover**:
- Competitive analysis: How might competitors leverage this?
- IP evaluation: What unique knowledge are we exposing?
- Security implications: How will public scrutiny affect security posture?
- Mitigation strategies for identified risks

### 4. License Selection

Recommend an appropriate license based on your strategic goals.

**Options to Consider**:
- **Permissive** (MIT, Apache 2.0): For maximum adoption and minimum friction
- **Weak Copyleft** (LGPL): For library components where you want modifications shared
- **Strong Copyleft** (GPL): For ensuring all derivative works remain open
- **Source-Available**: If true open source doesn't align with business needs

### 5. Success Metrics

Define how you'll measure the success of the open source initiative.

**Potential Metrics**:
- External contribution rate
- Adoption metrics
- Community growth
- Improved quality measures
- Talent acquisition benefits

## Common Executive Concerns

Be prepared to address these frequent executive concerns:

### "Why give away our work for free?"

**Effective Response**: "We're not giving away our core IP. We're building our reputation, improving our talent pipeline, and accelerating adoption of our platform. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have demonstrated that strategic open sourcing can create more value than it gives away."

### "Won't our competitors benefit more than we do?"

**Effective Response**: "We've analyzed the competitive landscape and identified that our advantage comes from [specific capabilities], not from this component. By open sourcing, we can shift industry resources toward a part of the stack that isn't our core differentiator."

### "How do we know this will actually be used or contributed to?"

**Effective Response**: "We've identified similar projects with active communities, researched potential users, and developed a community growth strategy. The component solves a common problem that currently lacks a good open solution."

### "What about security vulnerabilities?"

**Effective Response**: "While public code does receive more scrutiny, evidence suggests this typically improves security through the 'many eyes' principle. We'll implement proper security practices, including vulnerability disclosure processes and regular security reviews."

## Case Study Examples

### When Open Sourcing Succeeded

**Meta's React Framework**:
- Strategic rationale: Standardize frontend development across the industry
- Business benefit: Created ecosystem of tools and talent, established Meta as technical leader
- Key success factor: Solved a genuine industry problem with an innovative approach

### When Open Sourcing Wasn't Ideal

**Proprietary Algorithm Release**:
- Challenge: Company released core analytical algorithm that differentiated their product
- Outcome: Competitors integrated the algorithm into more polished products
- Lesson: Core differentiating capabilities generally shouldn't be open sourced
