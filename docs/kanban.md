## Test Pyramid Strategy

Our testing approach follows the Test Pyramid model, ensuring appropriate test coverage at all levels:

```
    /\
   /  \
  /    \
 / E2E  \       Fewer acceptance tests (End-to-end)
/--------\
/          \
/ Integration \   More integration tests
/--------------\
/                \
/     Unit        \  Many unit tests
/------------------\
```

### 1. Unit Tests (Base Layer)
- Focus on testing individual components in isolation
- Mock all dependencies
- Aim for high coverage (80%+)
- Fast execution
- Test both success and failure paths

### 2. Integration Tests (Middle Layer)
- Test interactions between components
- Use mock APIs for external services
- Focus on communication boundaries
- Verify error handling across components
- Test data flows and transformations

### 3. Acceptance Tests (Top Layer)
- Test complete workflows
- CLI command execution
- Focus on user-facing functionality
- Verify business requirements
- Use realistic but controlled test data

### 4. Performance Tests (Specialized)
- Benchmark key operations
- Measure throughput and scalability
- Test with large datasets
- Identify bottlenecks

## TDD Implementation Process

For each task in the above Kanban board, we will follow this TDD (Test-Driven Development) process:

1. **Write Tests First**:
   - Define expected behavior and outcomes
   - Create test fixtures with sample data
   - Implement test cases covering both positive and negative scenarios
   - Ensure tests initially fail (Red)

2. **Implement Functionality**:
   - Create minimal implementation to pass tests
   - Focus on correctness over optimization initially
   - Ensure all tests pass (Green)

3. **Refactor Code**:
   - Improve implementation while maintaining test coverage
   - Optimize for performance and readability
   - Extract common functionality into reusable components

4. **Extend Test Coverage**:
   - Add edge cases and error conditions
   - Implement integration tests with other components
   - Verify interfaces and contracts between components

5. **Document and Review**:
   - Add documentation for usage and maintenance
   - Review code with peers
   - Finalize implementation

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API rate limits | Migration slowdown | Implement adaptive rate limiting and batching |
| Data inconsistencies | Failed mappings | Add validation layers with clear error reporting |
| Large attachment volumes | Storage and bandwidth issues | Implement chunked uploads with checksums |

## Notes
- All components must include comprehensive test coverage at appropriate pyramid levels
- Follow the TDD process (Red-Green-Refactor) for all implementations
- Debug mode should provide verbose output for troubleshooting
- Each API client must have corresponding mock implementations
- Database should support transaction rollback for test isolation
- Implement proper connection pooling for database and API connections
- Include validation at all stages of the ETL process
- Logging should capture sufficient context for production troubleshooting
- All errors should be gracefully handled with clear user feedback
