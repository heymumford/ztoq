Open Source Decision Framework
============================

This document provides guidance for evaluating when to open source components of enterprise projects.

Strategic Considerations for Open Source Decisions

For a more detailed architectural framework, see :doc:`adrs/019-open-source-decision-framework`.

The decision framework presented here draws from Eric Mumford's comprehensive analysis "Open Source vs. Proprietary Software: Navigating the Modern Decision Landscape" (2025, available in ``docs/upload/open-source-economic-realities.pdf``), which examines the economic realities, strategic trade-offs, and changing landscape of open source software.

Key Findings from Mumford's Analysis
------------------------------------

* The open source movement has evolved significantly from its idealistic origins to become deeply intertwined with commercial strategies and corporate interests
* The choice between "open" and "closed" is rarely binary - hybrid models are prevalent
* Empirical evidence provides mixed support for universal claims of OSS superiority
* Beyond direct code contributions, OSS offers strategic value in talent acquisition, ecosystem building, and innovation
* Significant challenges persist in security, license compliance, funding, and strategic risk management

The decision to open source software components represents a complex strategic calculation that must be tailored to specific business contexts rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach or purely ideological preferences.

Scientifically Valid AI-Assisted Research
----------------------------------------

The analysis and framework were developed using a rigorous methodology for AI-assisted research:

1. **Converting Beliefs to Falsifiable Hypotheses**
   
   When using AI for research, it's critical to convert initial beliefs into falsifiable hypotheses that can be objectively tested. This is the foundation of scientific inquiry applied to AI-assisted research.
   
   *Example:* Instead of the general belief "Open source is better for security," formulate a testable hypothesis like "Open source projects demonstrate measurable reductions in the time between vulnerability discovery and patching compared to equivalent proprietary software."

2. **Gathering Balanced Evidence**
   
   For each hypothesis, evidence must be deliberately gathered that:
   
   * Supports the hypothesis
   * Contradicts the hypothesis
   * Provides neutral or contextual perspectives
   
   This three-pronged approach is essential for avoiding confirmation bias and ensuring scientific validity.

3. **Systematic Evaluation**
   
   Hypotheses must be rigorously tested against all collected evidence, with conclusions drawn based on the complete body of data rather than selectively chosen examples.
   
   This methodology represents the only scientifically valid approach to using AI as a research tool. By following this approach, the open source decision framework presented here is grounded in objective analysis rather than subjective preferences.
