# ADR-018: API-First Development and QA Empowerment

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As we develop the ZTOQ migration tool and its various APIs, we need to consider the most effective development methodology that supports both quality and velocity. We've observed several challenges in traditional development approaches:

1. QA teams are often blocked waiting for development to complete before they can begin testing
2. API design sometimes occurs concurrently with implementation, leading to inconsistencies and rework
3. Test coverage tends to focus on already-implemented features rather than planned functionality
4. A gap exists between the technical capabilities of development and QA teams
5. The advent of agentic AI in software engineering is changing development patterns

With the implementation of our API mocking harness, we have an opportunity to adopt a more effective approach.

## Decision

We will adopt an API-First development approach coupled with QA empowerment, specifically:

1. **Design APIs Before Implementation**: All APIs will be designed and documented using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications before implementation begins
2. **QA Involvement in API Design**: QA will participate in API design reviews to ensure testability
3. **Mock-Based Testing**: QA will use the API mocking harness to create comprehensive tests based on API specifications before implementation
4. **Technical Upskilling for QA**: We will invest in building QA's technical capabilities to effectively use mocking tools
5. **Test Pyramid Planning**: QA will develop test pyramids (unit, integration, system) aligned with each API before coding starts
6. **Value-Based Test Prioritization**: QA will use pairwise modeling and business input to prioritize test cases based on risk and value

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Parallel Development**: QA and development can work in parallel, unblocked from each other's timelines
2. **Higher Quality APIs**: Early focus on API design leads to more consistent, well-designed interfaces
3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Test planning before implementation ensures better coverage of edge cases
4. **Reduced Rework**: Early feedback on API design reduces the need for changes during implementation
5. **More Technical QA Capability**: QA teams develop stronger technical skills through mock implementation
6. **Preparation for AI**: This approach positions the team better for working with AI-augmented development

### Negative

1. **Initial Learning Curve**: QA teams will need time to become proficient with mocking tools and API design
2. **Upfront Time Investment**: More time is required at project start for API design and mock implementation
3. **Documentation Maintenance**: API specifications must be kept in sync with implementation
4. **Potential for Overengineering**: Without careful management, APIs might be designed with unnecessary complexity

## Implementation Strategy

1. **API Design Phase**: Begin each feature with a dedicated API design phase, resulting in OpenAPI specifications
2. **Mock Implementation**: QA implements API mocks using the mocking harness based on specifications
3. **Test Planning**: QA performs pairwise testing, critical path analysis, and test pyramid planning
4. **Parallel Development**: Development implements the API while QA develops tests against the mock
5. **Continuous Validation**: Regular sync meetings ensure API implementation matches the specification
6. **Technical Workshops**: Regular sessions to upskill QA on API concepts and mock implementation
