# ADR-019: Open Source Decision Framework for Enterprise Projects

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Modern software development commonly involves decisions about whether to keep components proprietary or release them as open source. Engineering teams frequently request to open source portions of their work, while management often has legitimate concerns about protecting intellectual property, competitive advantage, and security. This tension requires a structured framework for making informed decisions that balance idealistic benefits with pragmatic economic realities.

A significant internal analysis, "Open Source vs. Proprietary Software: Navigating the Modern Decision Landscape" by Eric C. Mumford, provides a comprehensive review of open source philosophies, economic realities, and strategic considerations. This document synthesizes that analysis to provide a practical decision framework.

## Decision

We will adopt a structured, evidence-based approach to open source decisions, recognizing that this is a strategic choice rather than a simple ideological preference. This framework will guide both engineering teams and leadership in evaluating when open sourcing is appropriate.

### Key Principles

1. **Strategic Alignment**: Open source decisions must align with business objectives rather than ideological preferences.

2. **Value Protection**: Core components that represent key competitive advantages should generally remain proprietary unless there's an overriding strategic reason to open them.

3. **Community Potential**: Components should be considered for open sourcing when they have genuine potential for community enhancement or when commoditizing them benefits the organization.

4. **Resource Commitment**: Open source is not "free" - it requires significant investment in documentation, community management, and governance.

5. **Evidence Over Assumptions**: Decisions should consider empirical evidence rather than assuming universal benefits.

### Decision Framework for Executives

When engineering teams request to open source a component, executives should evaluate:

1. **Strategic Value Assessment**:
   - Does the component provide core competitive differentiation?
   - Would commoditizing this technology benefit our strategic position?
   - Is establishing a standard or growing an ecosystem around this technology valuable?

2. **Resource Evaluation**:
   - Can we commit resources to maintain this as a proper open source project?
   - Are we prepared to manage community relations, contributions, and governance?
   - Can we maintain appropriate security practices with increased visibility?

3. **Risk Analysis**:
   - What IP exposure risks exist?
   - How would competitors potentially benefit from access?
   - What licensing strategy balances adoption with protection?

4. **Community Potential**:
   - Is there realistic potential for external contributions?
   - Would a broader community of users improve the technology?
   - Does this solve a problem others likely face?

5. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Could "InnerSource" (internal open source practices) achieve similar benefits?
   - Would a more limited release (APIs, documentation, etc.) suffice?
   - Would a source-available license better serve business needs?

### Implementation Guidelines

When open sourcing is approved:

1. Choose appropriate licensing based on strategic goals
2. Establish clear governance and contribution processes
3. Allocate dedicated resources for community management
4. Set measurable objectives for the open source initiative
5. Implement regular reviews to assess outcomes against expectations

## Consequences

### Positive

- Provides a structured approach to evaluating open source requests
- Balances idealistic benefits with pragmatic business considerations
- Prevents both automatic rejection and uncritical acceptance of open source requests
- Ensures resource commitments are considered before projects are open sourced
- Aligns technical decisions with business strategy

### Negative

- Introduces additional process for engineering initiatives
- May create tension between proponents of open source and business leadership
- Requires ongoing evaluation and governance resources

### Neutral

- Organizations will likely maintain a mix of open and closed source components
- Different components will warrant different decisions based on their strategic context

## AI-Assisted Research Methodology

The analysis behind this framework was developed using a rigorous, scientific approach to AI-assisted research:

1. **Falsifiable Hypothesis Formulation**: 
   - Initial open source beliefs were converted into falsifiable hypotheses
   - Example: "Open source code has higher quality than proprietary code" â†’ "Projects that transition from closed to open source demonstrate measurable improvements in code quality metrics within 12 months"

2. **Balanced Evidence Collection**:
   - Evidence was deliberately gathered that supported, contradicted, and provided neutral perspectives on each hypothesis
   - Research included both academic studies and industry experiences, avoiding confirmation bias

3. **Systematic Evaluation**:
   - Hypotheses were tested against the collected evidence
   - Conclusions were drawn based on the weight of evidence, not preconceived beliefs
   - Contextual factors that influence outcomes were identified

This scientifically valid approach to AI-assisted research enabled a more objective assessment of open source benefits and challenges, leading to a nuanced decision framework rather than a one-size-fits-all recommendation.
