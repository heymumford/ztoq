# ADR 020: Resource Management Strategy

## Status

Accepted (2025-04-17)

## Context

As the ZTOQ system has grown with features for handling large-scale data migrations between test management systems, we've encountered several resource management challenges that impact system performance, stability, and memory usage:

1. **Connection Leaks**: Long-running operations, especially with parallel processing, have led to connection leaks when connections to external APIs or databases are not properly closed.

2. **Memory Leaks**: The work queue system for managing parallel tasks was retaining completed work items indefinitely, leading to unbounded memory growth during large migrations.

3. **Thread Safety Issues**: Concurrent operations in shared resources like connection pools and singletons were causing race conditions and potential deadlocks.

4. **Resource Cleanup**: The system lacked consistent patterns for cleaning up resources, particularly in error paths and asynchronous operations.

5. **User Directory References**: Hard-coded user directory paths were creating portability issues when the system was deployed in different environments.

## Decision

We have implemented a comprehensive resource management strategy with the following key components:

1. **Automated Resource Cleanup**:
   - Connection pools implement automatic cleanup of idle connections after a configurable period
   - Work queues implement configurable limits for completed items with automatic cleanup
   - Thread-local sessions are automatically cleaned up when threads exit
   - Circuit breakers used for API resilience are periodically cleaned up

2. **Thread Safety Enhancements**:
   - Implemented thread-safe connection pool management with double-checked locking pattern
   - Added proper synchronization for shared resources
   - Reduced lock contention by performing expensive operations outside critical sections
   - Ensured safe iteration over connection pools with thread-safe pool copying

3. **Context Manager Pattern**:
   - Standardized use of context managers for all resource-intensive operations
   - Ensured proper resource cleanup even in error paths
   - Implemented automated cleanup hooks for resources that can't use context managers

4. **Daemon Threads for Background Cleanup**:
   - Used daemon threads for non-blocking cleanup operations
   - Ensured application can exit gracefully even if cleanup is in progress

5. **Path Portability**:
   - Replaced hard-coded user directory paths with relative paths or platform-independent approaches
   - Created a unit test to scan for and prevent personal directory references
   - Used dynamic path resolution based on the current user when needed

6. **Explicit Cleanup Methods**:
   - Added explicit cleanup methods to client classes for manual resource management
   - Created global cleanup functions for resources that span multiple components

7. **Documentation and Best Practices**:
   - Created comprehensive resource management documentation
   - Established best practices for context manager usage, timeouts, exception handling, and memory optimization

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Improved Stability**: The system can now run for extended periods without resource leaks, even when processing hundreds of thousands of records.

2. **Better Memory Utilization**: Automatic cleanup of completed work items and other resources prevents unbounded memory growth.

3. **Enhanced Resilience**: Proper error handling and resource cleanup in exception paths ensures the system can recover gracefully from failures.

4. **Improved Portability**: Removal of hard-coded paths and better environment handling makes the system more portable across different environments.

5. **Simplified Resource Management**: Consistent patterns and explicit cleanup methods make resource management more predictable and easier to implement correctly.

6. **Graceful Shutdown**: The system can now exit cleanly without hanging due to background cleanup processes.

### Negative

1. **Increased Complexity**: Some components are now more complex due to added thread safety and cleanup mechanisms.

2. **Overhead**: There is a small performance overhead from additional synchronization and cleanup operations.

3. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand and follow resource management patterns consistently.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Resource Management**:
   - We considered requiring explicit resource cleanup throughout the codebase
   - Rejected because it places too much burden on developers and is error-prone

2. **Garbage Collection Alone**:
   - We considered relying solely on Python's garbage collector for resource cleanup
   - Rejected because GC doesn't handle external resources like connections and files reliably

3. **Process-Based Isolation**:
   - We considered using separate processes for isolation instead of thread safety measures
   - Rejected due to the overhead of inter-process communication and memory duplication
