# ADR-018: Balancing Concrete and Conceptual Thinking in Open Source Development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The ZTOQ project aims to be both a practical tool for test data migration and an educational resource for software development best practices. As we've developed the project and considered its open source implications, we've recognized the need to balance two distinct but complementary modes of thinking:

1. **Concrete thinking**: Building practical, working code by example; solving immediate problems with direct implementations; focusing on tangible, specific solutions.

2. **Conceptual thinking**: Developing abstract models and frameworks; identifying patterns and principles; designing for extensibility and flexibility.

We observed that the perception that "script-based solutions are rushed" unfairly characterizes the work of concrete thinkers. In reality, both modes of thinking have their strengths and weaknesses, and truly effective software development requires a balance of both approaches.

Key considerations include:
- The relationship between concrete and conceptual thinking in software development
- How open source projects can accommodate and benefit from both thinking styles
- Ways to facilitate the development of concrete thinkers into more conceptual thinkers
- The necessity for conceptual thinkers to ground their ideas in concrete implementations

## Decision

We will explicitly acknowledge and support both concrete and conceptual thinking in the ZTOQ project through the following strategies:

### Documentation and Educational Resources

1. **Multi-level Documentation**:
   - Provide both high-level conceptual overviews (architecture diagrams, design principles)
   - Include concrete, practical examples (code snippets, step-by-step guides)
   - Connect conceptual explanations to concrete implementations to show the relationship

2. **Learning Pathways**:
   - Create distinct learning paths for both concrete and conceptual learners
   - Build bridges between concrete examples and their underlying principles
   - Develop progressive examples that gradually introduce more conceptual thinking

### Code Organization

1. **Example-Driven Development**:
   - Maintain a rich collection of examples that demonstrate practical solutions
   - Implement core functionality first in concrete examples, then abstract as patterns emerge
   - Document the evolution from concrete implementation to conceptual framework

2. **Balanced Module Structure**:
   - Organize code to provide both high-level abstractions and concrete implementations
   - Use interfaces and abstract classes for conceptual organization
   - Provide concrete implementations and practical utilities for immediate use

### Contribution Guidelines

1. **Diverse Contribution Pathways**:
   - Explicitly value both conceptual contributions (architecture, design) and concrete contributions (implementations, examples)
   - Create contribution guides for different thinking styles
   - Pair conceptual and concrete thinkers on collaborative tasks

2. **Review Process**:
   - Include reviewers with different thinking styles
   - Evaluate contributions on both conceptual integrity and practical utility
   - Encourage dialogue between different perspectives during reviews

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Inclusive Community**: The project becomes accessible to developers with diverse thinking styles
- **Balanced Architecture**: The codebase benefits from both robust abstractions and practical implementations
- **Learning Opportunities**: Contributors can develop their conceptual thinking through concrete examples
- **Reduced Technical Debt**: The balance prevents both over-engineering and under-designed solutions
- **Broader Adoption**: Different users can engage with the project at their preferred level of abstraction

### Negative

- **Communication Challenges**: Bridging different thinking styles requires additional communication effort
- **Documentation Overhead**: Supporting multiple learning paths increases documentation requirements
- **Integration Complexity**: Ensuring coherence between conceptual frameworks and concrete implementations adds complexity
- **Potential Tensions**: Differences in thinking styles may lead to disagreements about priorities and approaches

## Implementation Details

1. **Documentation Structure**:
   - Create a "Concepts and Examples" section in docs that explicitly pairs conceptual explanations with concrete code samples
   - Develop a "From Concrete to Conceptual" guide showing the evolution of a specific feature

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Implement a layered architecture with clear separation between conceptual interfaces and concrete implementations
   - Include both utility functions (concrete) and framework components (conceptual)

3. **Educational Resources**:
   - Develop tutorials that start with simple concrete examples and gradually introduce more conceptual elements
   - Create visualization tools that help concrete thinkers see the patterns in their implementations

4. **Contribution Process**:
   - Update contribution guidelines to explicitly welcome different thinking styles
   - Create issue templates for both concrete improvements and conceptual enhancements
   - Establish mentoring relationships between contributors with complementary thinking styles

## Review

This approach will be reviewed semi-annually to assess its effectiveness in:
- Attracting and retaining contributors with diverse thinking styles
- Building a codebase that balances practical utility with conceptual integrity
- Helping concrete thinkers develop more conceptual perspectives
- Ensuring conceptual designs are grounded in practical implementations

Success metrics will include:
- Diversity of contribution types and contributor backgrounds
- Quality and maintainability of the codebase over time
- Feedback from users with different learning styles
- Reduction in technical debt and implementation gaps
