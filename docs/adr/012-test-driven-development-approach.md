# ADR-012: Test-Driven Development Approach

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the ZTOQ project grows in complexity with the addition of qTest integration, we need to ensure code quality, maintainability, and reliability. We're faced with several challenges:

1. Building complex API interactions with multiple systems
2. Ensuring data integrity during migration
3. Handling diverse entity types and their transformations
4. Supporting error recovery and partial migrations
5. Maintaining a consistent architecture as the codebase grows

We need to establish a development methodology that emphasizes quality and prevents regressions while enabling rapid development.

## Decision

We will adopt a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for all feature development in ZTOQ. This decision entails:

1. **"Test First" Principle**:
   - Writing acceptance tests before implementation for all features
   - Ensuring tests initially fail (Red phase)
   - Implementing minimal code to make tests pass (Green phase)
   - Refactoring while maintaining test coverage (Refactor phase)

2. **Test Levels**:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Acceptance tests for end-to-end workflows
   - Performance tests for throughput and scalability

3. **Test Organization**:
   - Tests mirror the source code structure
   - Use of pytest markers to categorize tests
   - Consistent naming conventions for test files and functions

4. **Mocking Strategy**:
   - Mock servers for Zephyr and qTest APIs
   - Comprehensive fixtures for all entity types
   - Simulation of error conditions and edge cases

5. **Workflow Integration**:
   - Test tasks explicitly defined in the Kanban board
   - No implementation work begins before corresponding tests
   - PRs require comprehensive test coverage

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Higher Quality**: Catches issues early in the development process
2. **Better Design**: Forces modular, testable code architecture
3. **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation of system behavior
4. **Regression Prevention**: Ensures changes don't break existing functionality
5. **Developer Confidence**: Provides assurance when refactoring complex code
6. **Incremental Progress**: Makes progress visible and measurable

### Negative

1. **Initial Time Investment**: Writing tests first requires more upfront time
2. **Learning Curve**: Developers may need to adapt to the test-first approach
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Tests must be maintained alongside application code
4. **Testing Complexity**: Some scenarios (concurrency, timing) can be difficult to test

## Implementation Details

### Test Structure

Tests will be organized in a parallel structure to the source code:

```
ztoq/                   # Source code
├── client.py
└── models.py
tests/                  # Test code
├── unit/               # Unit tests
│   ├── test_client.py
│   └── test_models.py
└── integration/        # Integration tests
    ├── test_api.py
    └── test_cli.py
```

### Test Patterns

1. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with clear setup, action, and verification
2. **Given-When-Then**: Use behavior-driven syntax for acceptance tests
3. **Parameterized Tests**: Use pytest parameterization for testing multiple scenarios
4. **Test Fixtures**: Create reusable test fixtures for common test data

### Test Tooling

1. **pytest**: Primary test framework
2. **pytest-cov**: Test coverage reporting
3. **pytest-mock**: Mocking utilities
4. **pytest-timeout**: Test timeout protection

### Coverage Requirements

1. Unit tests: Aim for 90%+ code coverage
2. Integration tests: Cover all key workflows
3. Edge cases: Tests for error handling, boundary conditions

## Review

This approach will be reviewed after three months of implementation to assess its effectiveness and make adjustments as needed. Success metrics will include:

1. Defect reduction rate
2. Code coverage percentage
3. Development velocity
4. Developer satisfaction
