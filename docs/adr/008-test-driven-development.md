# ADR-008: Test-Driven Development Approach

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The ZTOQ project is a critical tool for extracting and managing test data from Zephyr Scale. Given its importance in testing workflows, we need a development approach that ensures high code quality, comprehensive test coverage, and reliable functionality. We need to decide on a consistent development methodology that will guide our implementation process.

The primary options considered were:
1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Writing tests before implementing functionality
2. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** - Focusing on business value and behavior specifications
3. **Feature-Driven Development (FDD)** - Organizing work around feature sets
4. **Traditional development with post-implementation testing**

## Decision

We will adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) as our primary development methodology for the ZTOQ project, following principles from Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and Martin Fowler.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Ensures high test coverage (targeting 100% for critical components)
- Encourages modular, decoupled design
- Forces consideration of interfaces and contracts before implementation
- Provides fast feedback on regressions
- Documents expected behavior through tests
- Reduces debugging time in later stages
- Promotes confidence in refactoring
- Ensures code works as expected from the beginning

### Negative

- May increase initial development time
- Requires discipline from the development team
- Can lead to over-testing if not carefully managed
- May require additional test infrastructure maintenance
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with TDD

## Implementation Details

### Test Pyramid Structure

Following Martin Fowler's test pyramid approach, we will structure our tests in three layers:

```
    /\
   /  \
  /    \    End-to-End Tests (few)
 /      \
/________\
/        \
/          \  Integration Tests (some)
/            \
/______________\
/              \
/                \
/                  \  Unit Tests (many)
/____________________\
```

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual functions and classes in isolation
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Fast execution time
   - Cover edge cases and error conditions
   - Target: 100% code coverage

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Focus on API, storage, and client functionality
   - Limited mocking, more real interactions
   - Target: key integration paths

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Test complete workflows from CLI to storage
   - Use test fixtures representing real data
   - Validate entire system behavior
   - Focus on main use cases

### TDD Process

For each component or feature, we will follow this process:

1. **Red Phase**:
   - Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior
   - Ensure the test is clear, focused, and fails for the right reason

2. **Green Phase**:
   - Implement the minimal code needed to make the test pass
   - Focus on functionality, not perfection

3. **Refactor Phase**:
   - Improve the implementation while keeping tests green
   - Apply clean code principles and design patterns
   - Eliminate duplication and improve naming

### Testing Frameworks and Tools

- **pytest** - Primary testing framework
- **pytest-cov** - Coverage reporting
- **unittest.mock** - For mocking dependencies
- **hypothesis** (optional) - For property-based testing

### Continuous Integration Integration

- Tests will run automatically on each commit
- Coverage reports will be generated and tracked
- Test failures will block merges to main branches

## Examples

### Example Unit Test

```python
def test_serialize_value():
    """Test serializing different types of values."""
    # Setup
    manager = DatabaseManager(":memory:")
    
    # Test dict serialization
    assert manager._serialize_value({"key": "value"}) == '{"key": "value"}'
    
    # Test datetime serialization
    dt = datetime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)
    assert manager._serialize_value(dt) == "2023-01-01T12:00:00"
    
    # Test None value
    assert manager._serialize_value(None) is None
```

### Example Integration Test

```python
def test_save_project_data():
    """Test saving all project data from fetch results."""
    # Setup database
    db_manager = DatabaseManager(":memory:")
    db_manager.initialize_database()
    
    # Create test data and fetch results
    project = Project(id="proj123", key="TEST", name="Test Project")
    fetch_results = {
        "project": FetchResult(
            entity_type="project",
            project_key="TEST",
            items=[project],
            count=1,
            success=True
        ),
        # ... other entity results ...
    }
    
    # Execute the operation
    result = db_manager.save_project_data("TEST", fetch_results)
    
    # Verify results
    assert result["project"] == 1
    # ... verify other counts ...
    
    # Verify database state
    with db_manager.get_connection() as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM projects WHERE key = ?", ("TEST",))
        saved_project = cursor.fetchone()
        assert saved_project is not None
        assert saved_project["name"] == "Test Project"
```
