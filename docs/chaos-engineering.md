# Chaos Engineering in ZTOQ

This document outlines the chaos engineering strategy for the ZTOQ project, based on the Antifragile and Black Swan Design Principles outlined in [ADR-016](adr/016-anti-fragile-and-black-swan-concepts.md).

## Introduction to Chaos Engineering

Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system to build confidence in its capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production. By deliberately injecting failures and observing how the system responds, we strengthen its resilience and improve our understanding of its behavior under stress.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation of chaos engineering in ZTOQ will follow these phases:

1. **Setup Phase**: Establish the chaos engineering infrastructure
2. **Basic Chaos**: Implement fundamental failure simulations
3. **Advanced Scenarios**: Create complex, multi-failure scenarios
4. **Continuous Chaos**: Integrate chaos testing into CI/CD pipelines

## Chaos Experiment Types

### Network Failures

- API connectivity interruptions
- Network latency simulation
- DNS resolution failures
- Partial network partitioning

### API Disturbances

- Rate limiting simulation
- Random API errors (4xx and 5xx responses)
- Slow response times
- Invalid response formats

### Database Chaos

- Connection pool exhaustion
- Database service interruptions
- Corrupted query results
- Transaction deadlocks
- Schema migration failures

### Resource Constraints

- Memory limitations
- CPU contention
- Disk space exhaustion
- I/O performance degradation

## Metrics and Observability

During chaos experiments, we'll be monitoring:

- System recovery time
- Error rates and patterns
- Resource utilization
- User-visible impact
- Silent failure detection rates

## Tools and Implementation

We'll be implementing chaos engineering using:

- **Chaos Toolkit**: For basic experiment orchestration
- **Custom Pytest Extensions**: For integrating chaos into our testing framework
- **Fault Injection Middleware**: For API-level chaos
- **Database Proxies**: For database failure simulation

## Chaos Experiment Template

Each chaos experiment will be documented using the following format:

```yaml
name: "Experiment Name"
description: "Detailed description of what this experiment tests"
hypothesis:
  title: "What we expect to happen"
  description: "More details about our expectations"
steady_state:
  title: "The normal functioning state"
  probes:
    - name: "Check API responsiveness"
      type: "http"
      url: "http://api-endpoint"
      # ...
method:
  - type: "action"
    name: "Inject failure"
    provider: "custom-provider"
    # Configuration specific to this chaos action
rollback:
  - type: "action"
    name: "Restore normal operation"
    provider: "custom-provider"
```

## Safety Guidelines

To ensure chaos engineering is performed safely:

1. Always start in development/test environments
2. Establish clear abort conditions
3. Notify all stakeholders before larger experiments
4. Have rollback procedures in place
5. Document all findings, even minor ones

## Future Work

This document will be expanded as we implement the chaos engineering practices outlined in the kanban board. The ANTIFRAGILE-1 through ANTIFRAGILE-13 tasks will progressively enhance our capabilities in this area.
